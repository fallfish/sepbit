Grouping:
The aim of grouping volumes is to fully enjoy the memory-efficient indexmap
implementation. The rationale is that a group of volumes have diverse workload
patterns (skewed and non-skewed), thus caching can have a good hit ratio
(overall a skewed workload).

Content:
The selected volumes are listed in order of file sizes.  As a result, the
divide.py can evenly split them into groups so that we can parallel the
simulation.
